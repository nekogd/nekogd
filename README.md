### Hi, I am Igor

I work as Head of Engineering.

I take pride with the fantastic team I have the privilege to work with.

Tech wise, I'm mostly focused on web technologies. 
I had worked as a fullstack, backend heavier, developer.

The profile picture you can see is taken at 2018, with my wonderful cat Milus.
